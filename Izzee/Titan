    <h1>The Unlucky Titan</h1>
    <p>Titan, previously called Cyclops 2, was an experimental submersible that imploded on 18 June 2023 while transporting tourists to visit the wreckage of Titanic. The submersible was created and operated by OceanGate. It was the first privately-owned submersible with a claimed maximum depth of 4,000 m (13,000 ft), and the first completed crewed submersible with a hull constructed of titanium and carbon fiber composite materials.

<p>After testing with dives to its maximum intended depth in 2018 and 2019, the original composite hull of Titan developed fatigue damage and was replaced by 2021. In that year, OceanGate began transporting paying customers to the wreck of Titanic, completing several dives to the wreck site in 2021 and 2022. During the submersible's first expedition in 2023, all five occupants were killed when the Titan imploded. OceanGate lost contact with Titan and contacted authorities later that day after the submersible was overdue for return. A massive international search and rescue operation ensued and ended on 22 June, when debris from Titan was discovered about 1,600 feet (500 metres) from the bow of Titanic.
