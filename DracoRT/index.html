      <h1> The Titan tragedy </h1>
      <p> Oceans are the last unknown frontier on our planet. In a bid to explore the wreckage of Titanic, a tragic accident claimed the lives of five people aboard the Titan, a deep-sea submersible. The vessel imploded under the intense pressure of the Atlantic Ocean, near the wreckage of the Titanic, killing all passengers onboard instantly. Among the casualties were some of the most prominent figures in ocean exploration and business, including OceanGate CEO and founder Stockton Rush, and Pakistani millionaire Shahzada Dawood and his son. </p>
      <p> The sub's mission was a dangerous one, to descend to the depths where the iconic Titanic shipwreck rests, more than 12,000 feet below the ocean surface. But, while the risks of deep-sea exploration are known, what exactly went wrong during the Titan's fatal descent remains a mystery. All that is known at the moment is that the submersible underwent a catastrophic implosion, as the ocean around it crushed the vehicle like an empty aluminium can within milliseconds. </p>
