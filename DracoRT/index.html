      <h1> The Titan tragedy </h1>
      <p id="para-1" class="red"> Oceans are the last unknown frontier on our planet. In a bid to explore the wreckage of Titanic, a tragic accident claimed the lives of five people aboard the Titan, a deep-sea submersible. The vessel imploded under the intense pressure of the Atlantic Ocean, near the wreckage of the Titanic, killing all passengers onboard instantly. Among the casualties were some of the most prominent figures in ocean exploration and business, including OceanGate CEO and founder Stockton Rush, and Pakistani millionaire Shahzada Dawood and his son. </p>
      <p id="para-2" class="yellow"> The five people aboard had been enroute to visit the remains of the Titanic some 12,500 feet below the surface. The experimental submersible succumbed to the immense pressure of the depths with the hull failing causing a “catastrophic implosion” killing all aboard instantly. These are the people who were on the ill-fated Titan. </p>

      <p id="para-3" class="green">Earlier in the week, Canadian search planes reported hearing undersea noises. It remains unclear what these noises were, and authorities have cautioned they may not have been related to the Titan.Thursday's announcement that a debris field was found is so far the only potential clue discovered by ROVs that have been deployed to the area.One of the ROVs, deployed from the Canadian vessel Horizon Arctic, reached the ocean floor early Thursday morning. Several more were expected to arrive later in the day.</p>
      <p id="para-4" class="purple">A French research ship, the Atalante, also arrived in the area on Thursday morning and deployed its own ROV, the US Coast Guard said. That robot is capable of reaching depths below the Titanic wreck, which lies about 12,500 ft (3,810m) below the surface, and has experience of surveying the Titanic.The overall area of sea being scoured is about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles), twice the size of the US state of Connecticut. The area is prone to stormy conditions and poor visibility which makes search operations more challenging, experts say.</p>
