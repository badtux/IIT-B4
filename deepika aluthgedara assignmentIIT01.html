<h1>Submarine Building Course Program</h1>
<h2>Week 1:Introduction to Submarine Design</h2>
<p>In the first week,we will cover the basics of submarine design,including the history of submarines,keyprinciples,and the
<br>different types of submarines.Students will gain a solid foudation in submarine construction and operation.
</p>
<h2>Week 2:Materials and Construction</h2>
<p>This week,we'll dive into the materials used in submarine construction and the techniques involved in building a submarine.
<br>Toppics will include pressure hulls,ballast systems,and various engineering considerations for submersible vessels.
</p>
<h2>week 3:Propulsion Systems</h2>
<p>Week 3 will focus on propulsion systems for systems for submarines.Students will learn about different type of propulsion,such as
<br>nuclear,diesel-electric,and air-indipendent propulsion.We'll also discuss the pros and cons of each system.</p>
<h2>Week 4:Submarine operations and Safety</h2>
<p>During this week,we'll explora various submarine operation and safety measure.Topics include underwater navigation,
<br>communication,life support systems,and emergency procedures.Student will gain insights into the challenges of operating a
<br>submarine and ensuring the well-being of the crew during extended underwater mission.
