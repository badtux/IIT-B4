<p> The missing craft is believed to be OceanGate's Titan submersible, a truck-sized sub that holds five people and usually dives with a four-day emergency supply of oxygen.</p>
<p> Tickets cost $250,000 (Â£195,000) for an eight-day trip including dives to the wreck at a depth of 3,800m (12,500ft).</p>
