    <h1>Submarine Building Course Program</h1>
    <h2>Week 1: Introduction to<br>Submarine design</h2>
    <p> In the first week, We will cover the basics of subamrine<br> design,including the history of submarines,key<br>principles,and the different types of submarines.<br>students will gain a solid foundation in submarine<br>construction and operation.
    </p>
    <h2>Week 2:Materials and <br>Construction</h2>
    <p>This week , we'll dive into the materials used in<br> submarine construction and the techniques involved in<br>building a submarine. Topics will include pressure hulls.<br>ballast systems, and various engineering considerations<br>for submersible vessels.</p>
<h2>Week:3 propulsions systems</h2>
<p>Week 3 will focus on propulsion systems<br>submarines. students will learn about diferent types of <br> propulsion, such as nuclear, diesel-electric, and air-<br> independent propulsion. we'll also discuss the pros and<br> cons of each system. </p>
<h2>Week 4;:Submarine Operations<br> and Safety</h2>
<p>During this week, we'll explore various submarine<br> operations and safety measures. Topics include<br> underwater navigation, communication, life support<br> systems, and emergency procedures.students will gain<br> insights into the challenges of operating a submarine<br> and ensuring the well-being of the crew during extended<br>underwater missions.</p>

<H2>Final Project: Submarine<br>Design and Presentation</H2>
<p>During the final week,students will work on a group<br> project to design a hypothetical submarine for a specific<br>mission.Each group will present their design to the<br> class, explaining the rationale behind the choices.</p>
<h3>Prerequisties</h3>
<p>optional prerequisties for students who want to further<br> enhance their understanding:</p>
<ol><li>A basic understanding of engineering principles.</li>
<li>Familiarity with physics and mathematics</li>
<li>An interest in marine technology and exploration</li></ol>
<h3>Course Duration</h3>
<p>The course will run for a total of 4 weeks , with one 2-<br>hour session per week.</p>
<h3>Certification</h3>
<p>Students who successfully complete the course will<br>receive a certifiacte of completion in submarine<br> building.</p>
