    <h1> Submarine Building Course Program</h1>
    <h2>Week 1: Introduction to Submarine Design</h2>
    <p>In the first week, we will cover the basics of submarine design, including the history of submarines, 
        key principles, and the different types of submarines. Students will gain a solid foundation in submarine construction
        and operation.</p>

    <h2>Week 2: Materials and Construction</h2>
    <p>This week, we'll dive into the materials used in submarine construction and the techniques involved in building a 
        submarine.Topics will include pressure hulls, ballast systems, and various engineering considerations for submersible
        vessels.</p>

    <h2>Week 3: Propulsion Systems</h2>
    <p>Week 3 will focus on propulsion systems for submarines. Students will learn about different types of propulsion, 
    such as nuclear, diesel-electric, and air-independent propulsion. We'll also discuss the pros and cons of each system.</p>

    <h2>Week 4: Submarine Operations and Safety</h2>
    <p>During this week, we'll explore various submarine operations and safety measures. Topics include underwater navigation,
         communication, life support systems, and emergency procedures. Students will gain insights into the challenges of 
         operating a submarine and ensuring the well-being of the crew during extended underwater missions.</p><br>
    <hr><br>
    <h2>Final Project: Submarine Design and Presentation</h2>
    <p>During the final week, students will work on a group project to design a hypothetical submarine for a specific mission.
         Each group will present their design to the class, explaining the rationale behind their choices.</p>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Optional prerequisites for students who want to further enhance their understanding:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A basic understanding of engineering principles</li>
        <li>Familiarity with physics and mathematics</li>
        <li>An interest in marine technology and exploration</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Course Duration</h3>
    <p>The course will run for a total of 4 weeks, with one 2-hour session per week.</p>

    <h3>Certification</h3>
    <p>Students who successfully complete the course will receive a certificate of completion in Submarine Building.</p>
