          <h3>History of submarines</h3>
          <p>Submarines first became a major factor in naval warfare during World War I (1914–18), when Germany employed them to destroy surface merchant vessels. In such attacks submarines used their primary weapon, a self-propelled underwater missile known as a torpedo. Submarines played a similar role on a larger scale in World War II (1939–45), in both the Atlantic (by Germany) and the Pacific (by the United States). In the 1960s the nuclear-powered submarine, capable of remaining underwater for months at a time and of firing long-range nuclear missiles without surfacing, became an important strategic weapon platform. Armed with torpedoes as well as antiship and antisubmarine missiles, the nuclear attack submarine has also become a key element of naval warfare.</p>

        <h3>Key principles of submarines</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Buoyancy and Ballast: Submarines are designed to be neutrally buoyant, meaning they can float and sink as needed. This is achieved by adjusting the amount of water in ballast tanks. To submerge, water is taken in to increase the submarine's weight, and to surface, the water is expelled to decrease the weight.</li>
            <li>Pressure Resistance: Submarines must withstand the tremendous pressure at various depths in the ocean. The hull and pressure hull are designed to handle the external pressure without collapsing.</li>
            <li>Propulsion: Submarines are propelled by various means, such as diesel-electric engines for surface travel and electric motors powered by batteries when submerged. Some advanced submarines also use nuclear reactors for extended underwater operations.</li>
            <li>Navigation and Sonar: Submarines rely on sonar systems for navigation, detecting other vessels, and identifying potential threats or targets. Sonar uses sound waves to map the underwater environment and provide situational awareness.</li>
            <li>Stealth and Acoustic Signature: Silence and low acoustic signature are crucial for submarines to avoid detection. Reducing noise from machinery and propellers helps them remain undetected underwater.</li>
