            Stockton Rush had an interest in aviation and space travel as a child, and obtained a commercial pilot's license when he was 18.[8] As an adult, his interests pivoted to undersea exploration. Rush had built his fortune by investing his inheritance in tech companies and decided to purchase a submarine. He discovered that he was unable to, as there were fewer than 100 privately-owned submarines worldwide. He instead built one from plans in 2006, a Kittredge K-350 which he named Suds.[10].Rush's experience and research led him to believe that he had discovered an unmet business opportunity to expand the market of private ocean exploration. He believed that this industry had been held back by two principal factors: submersibles having an unwarranted reputation as dangerous vehicles, due to their use as ferries for commercial divers, and rigid government regulations that inhibited innovation within the industry. In 2019 Rush expressed the view that the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 "needlessly prioritized passenger safety over commercial innovation", building on earlier assertions, including statements on the OceanGate website, which noted in 2011 that "since 1974, there has not been a serious injury or fatality on an ABS certified passenger submersible", and an address before The Explorers Club in 2017, where he called submersibles "the safest vehicles on the planet".Non-certified vehicles were more dangerous, as demonstrated by at least one fatality involving a homemade submersible in 1990.

            He later commissioned a marketing study which concluded there was sufficient demand for underwater ocean tourism which would in turn support the development of new, deep-diving submersibles that would enable lucrative commercial ventures including resource mining and disaster mitigation.The underwater tourism industry began in 1986 when Atlantis Adventures (now Atlantis Submarines) began providing submersible tours of the coral reefs near Grand Cayman Island. In 2003, more than two million passengers collectively paid US$150 million to ride underwater in submersibles, although these generally were operated in shallow depths.
