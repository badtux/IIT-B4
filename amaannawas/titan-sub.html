            <p style="size: 1px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
                On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by American tourism and expeditions company OceanGate, imploded 
                during an expedition to view the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, 
                Canada. OceanGate, the owner of the Titan submersible that imploded last month, killing all five passengers 
                on board, has fully suspended its activities. The company posted a one-line note on its website saying it 
                had stopped "all exploration and commercial operations".

                Perhaps they were trapped underwater within the hull of their broken-down submersible, running 
                out of air. Or perhaps they had suffered the worst-case scenario: a sudden, catastrophic hull breach, 
                causing their sub to rapidly buckle under the crushing pressure of the water above them. The Titan submersible 
                suffered a catastrophic implosion that likely killed its pilot and four passengers instantly amid the 
                intense water pressure in the deep North Atlantic, experts said.
