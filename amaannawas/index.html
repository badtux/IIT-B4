            On 18 June 2023, Titan, a submersible operated by American tourism and expeditions company OceanGate, 
            imploded during an expedition to view the wreck of the Titanic.

            Perhaps they were trapped underwater within the hull of their broken-down submersible, running 
            out of air. Or perhaps they had suffered the worst-case scenario: a sudden, catastrophic hull breach, 
            causing their sub to rapidly buckle under the crushing pressure of the water above them.

            The Titan submersible suffered a catastrophic implosion that likely killed its pilot and 
            four passengers instantly amid the intense water pressure in the deep North Atlantic, experts said.
