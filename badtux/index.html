            Chief investigator Cpt Jason Neubauer said last month that the Coast Guard had convened its highest level of investigation, and that the probe would be run jointly with Canadian, UK and French authorities. The investigation would be able to recommend civil or criminal charges, Cpt Neubauer said.

            On 28 June the Coast Guard said debris and human remains from the Titan had been recovered and returned to land - concluding an early stage of the investigation. Authorities said the debris would be taken to a US port for more analysis.
